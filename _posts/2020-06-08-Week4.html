<p>
    The improvements made to the models over the course of the past week include coupling acoustics and laser interaction in the thermal piston model, observing the effects of acoustic pressure on the diaphragm (the goal for thermal piston modeling), and combining the thermal piston model with laser heating of solid silicon (model from week 2). As a result, we were able to get a basic representation of the full photoacoustic effect.

    Laser Pulses Inducing Acoustic Pressure
</h2>

<p>
    The first figure below shows acoustic pressure hitting the diaphragm, and the second figure displays acoustic pressure over time:

<p>
    From these figures, we can see that laser pulses at 200Hz frequency are able to generate acoustic waves in ambient air (Relative Humidity: 50%). However, acoustic waves are greatest for the first pulse and an order of magnitude lower for subsequent waves. One reason for this may be that after light hits the air molecules for the first time, they reach excited states and do not lose enough energy to surrounding molecules before the second laser pulse hits. Another possibility is that the current model set-up is not enabling heat to disperse from the initial “box” of air (modeling error). 
</p>

<p>
    We sent laser pulses at 100Hz and 1 KHz to test whether lower frequency pulses could generate greater acoustic pressure, but regardless of the frequency of pulses, the acoustic pressure remained the same. This indicates that the problem is with the model itself, and something to work towards this upcoming week is to enable open boundaries between the box of air and the surrounding environment.

    Acoustic Pressure Inducing Vibrations
</h2>

<p>
    The vibrations caused by acoustic pressure are on the scale of 10^-21 m. This is much smaller than the vibrations caused by laser light directly hitting the solid (week 2) where vibrations were 10^-11 m. So, the photoacoustic effect is most likely not a result of the thermal piston model.

<h2 class="section-heading">
    Combination Model 
</h2>

<p>
    Putting together the thermal piston model and the laser heating of the diaphragm, we expected the laser heating model vibrations to dominate. However, the vibrations remained at the same order of magnitude as they were for the thermal piston model
</p>

<p>
    One possible reason for this could be that the laser intensity that is being absorbed by air is so great that the laser never reaches the diaphragm. However, intensity measurements at the top of the “box” of air, and at the diaphragm are nearly the same (see below), so the expected amount of laser light is still reaching the diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
    Another observation unique to the laser heating model is that greater intensity lasers increased vibrations. We repeated this test for the combination model and found that while the vibrations were still much lower than expected, the same pattern held true. In addition, with a higher powered, 10W laser, the vibrations appear to look much more like a sine wave (expected) than with the 60mW laser

<p>
    From the results of the two tests above, it seems as though there is another reason why the diaphragm is not vibrating as much as expected. A possibility for this is that heat is being transferred from the diaphragm to the air and thereby not allow for a thermoelastic wave to propagate through the silicon completely. More work needs to be done this week to test this as well as other consequences of combining the two models.

    More Future Improvements
</h2>

<p>
    Something that needs to be addressed is the wavelength of the laser. Depending on wavelength, the mean free path of light through air changes with smaller wavelengths undergoing absorption at a shorter distance through the air. This would change the acoustic pressure that hits the diaphragm. Unfortunately, the setting for wavelength is unclear on comsol, so more investigation needs to be done on which comsol physics module allows for user wavelength input.

    Paper Summary
</h2>

<p>
    This week, the paper that I focused on was WALNUT [1], and the section of the paper that I found most interesting was the mechanism behind the attack. To summarize, there are two vulnerable components in the signal processing chain for MEMs accelerometers- the amplifier and the low pass filter (LPF). The attack on the accelerometer exploits resonance frequency since inducing large vibrations of the accelerometer can lead to signal clipping in the amplifier and incomplete attenuation in the LPF. So, using only acoustic waves, it is possible to generate and control an electrical signal on the accelerometer.  
</p>

<p>
    I found the idea behind this attack really interesting. In other applications, reaching resonant frequency is a desired attribute (ex. clocks), so using resonant frequency as an attack method was really unexpected!
