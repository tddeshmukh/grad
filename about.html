<p>I am currently a Physics PhD student at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>
    How did I get here? Why a PhD program? For some people, the journey to graduate school is fairly linear: 
    discover a love for science in childhood, pursue a physics major in undergrad, participate in research 
    opportunities across subfields, and then apply to graduate school as the natural next step in life.

    Currently, I am working with Dr. Valluri from the University of Michigan Astronomy Department to
    study kinematics around black holes in disk galaxy simulations. We are looking at the
    M-Sigma relation in Illustris TNG-100 simulation galaxies and comparing the effect of 
    different velocity dispersion measurement methods on the relationship.

    I also work on researching light commands through the SPQR lab. Light commands are
    attacks on MEMs microphones where attackers can inject commands into voice-activated systems such as 
    Aexa, Siri and Google Assistant using laser-based audio injection. We are currently investigating the
    physics behind the attack by looking at consequences of the photoacoustic and photovoltaic effects.

<p class="mb-5">In the past, I have also researched water quality from a microbial perspective at
    the University of Glasgow (summer 2018).
