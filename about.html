<p>I am currently a Physics PhD student at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>
    How did I get here? Why a PhD program? For some people, the journey to graduate school is fairly linear: discover a love for science 
    in childhood, pursue a physics major in undergrad, and then apply to grad school as the natural next step in life. This was not the 
    case for me. I was told from an early age (largely as a consequence of Indian culture) that "acceptable" careers were those 
    that ensured stability and gave the largest monetary gains. A PhD program, 5+ years of high stress and minimal pay only to 
    specialize in a topic that may not land a job, was forbidden. So, even after loving my first physics classes in high school, the thought
    of a career in physics never crossed my mind. I contorted my own thoughts- the passion I felt for learning about the world around me was 
    nothing more than a consequence of hard work. It could be achieved anywhere. And an innate talent for analytical thinking; well, that 
    was the perfect tool in the hands of a doctor or engineer! I was studying physics because it was required of me. Nothing more, nothing less.

    When I entered college, I was intent on studying medicine. Doctor = $$$ + prestige. But it wasn't my dream, it was my parents dream.  My mom 
    would subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) mention how it would be nice to have a child that could one day be referred to as 
    doctor. And my dad agreed; he had once hoped to become a doctor himself, but fell short of his dreams by one point on his entrance exams. It 
    was down to my brother or I to carry their dreams forward. How could we not?! At 25 my parents sat down and came up with a plan, not for how they could succeed, but for how 
    their children could succeed. They left the only home they had ever known, leaving behind family and friends (leaving behind the sunshine!) 
    only to land in the Michigan winter where work hours were long and the days were increasingly lonely.  Every decision my parents made was with my brother and I
    at the forefront of their mind. So, straying from the status quo was not an option for me. I was, and still am, forever indebted to my parents.
    At 18, entering the University of Michigan, I was determined to become a doctor for the sake of my family's dreams.

    Currently, I am working with Dr. Valluri from the University of Michigan Astronomy Department to
    study kinematics around black holes in disk galaxy simulations. We are looking at the
    M-Sigma relation in Illustris TNG-100 simulation galaxies and comparing the effect of 
    different velocity dispersion measurement methods on the relationship.

    I also work on researching light commands through the SPQR lab. Light commands are
    attacks on MEMs microphones where attackers can inject commands into voice-activated systems such as 
    Aexa, Siri and Google Assistant using laser-based audio injection. We are currently investigating the
    physics behind the attack by looking at consequences of the photoacoustic and photovoltaic effects.

<p class="mb-5">In the past, I have also researched water quality from a microbial perspective at
    the University of Glasgow (summer 2018).
